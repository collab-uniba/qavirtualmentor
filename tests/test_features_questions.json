One of the motivations for this is also to have two versions of Python on my machine (Ubuntu 14.04) co-existing. I have the following wonders:</p><ol><li>In what order should Python, PIP and virtualenv be installed? Does it matter at all?</li><li>Once done, how can I keep two python versions separate under virtualenv?</li><li>Assume I am working on separate projects, is it recommended to keep each of the project in a separate folder created by virtualenv or not?</li></ol><p>I would like to know experts opinion in order to do things in the right manner and wisely.</p>",
